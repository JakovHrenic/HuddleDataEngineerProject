Hello.

I would like to quickly explain the situation of my assignment.
I had some problems with installing and configuring everything needed for this assignment:
SQL server, git, python, etc. I have a really old PC which has trouble handling such things.

I ran the two python scripts you can see in the repo.
I ran the SQL code for creating the schema, but I couldn't insert the data
in the tables I created. So I just wrote how an SQL code for Steps 5 and 6
would look like and should work.

In my previous work experience, our Data Engineering team was separated in two subteams:
Data Ops and Data Platform. We used ELT instead of the usual ETL.
Data Ops was in charge of Extract and Load,
and Data Platform (my team) was in charge of Transform.
So the process I showed here was kind of new to me, so it took more time
than I expected, and I had more problems with it that I inicitially thought.
But it brought me new experience, which I am happy with, and I am sure
that I would be able to finish the assignment in time if I had more time and-or experience.

Thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you!
